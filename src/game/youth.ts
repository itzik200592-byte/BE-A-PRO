/**
 * The youth academy.
 *
 * Players aged 16 to 18 who train at the club and are not in the senior squad.
 * Every season one of them takes a real step forward, so from the second season
 * on the manager feels the academy producing, and when a prospect turns 18 he is
 * offered a senior contract or released. It is the one part of the club that is
 * purely about the future, and building it is how a small club climbs without
 * money.
 *
 * A youth player is just a Player with an age in that band and a hidden ceiling,
 * the same devFactor the senior aging uses, so a kid who looks ordinary at 16
 * can still be the one who breaks out at 18.
