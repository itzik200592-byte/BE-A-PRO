/**
 * Bringing a friend in.
 *
 * The rule that makes this work is not a security rule, it is an economics one:
 * nobody is paid for a signup, they are paid once the friend they brought has
 * actually played. A gem is worth about one thirty second advert in this game,
 * so if faking a gem costs five rounds of football, roughly ten minutes, faking
 * is twenty times worse than just watching the advert. The cheat stops paying
 * for itself, which is a far stronger defence than anything a client can
 * enforce on its own.
 *
 * On top of that: a friend is counted once, your own device is refused, and the
 * whole thing is capped. What a client cannot do is stop a determined person
 * with two phones. Closing that needs a server, and when one exists only
 * `verifyThanks` changes; everything else here stays as it is.
