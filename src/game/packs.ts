/**
 * Gems and packs, the gacha layer.
 *
 * Gems are a SEPARATE currency from the club's shekels, deliberately. Nothing
 * in the calibrated economy can be converted into a gem, so no amount of
 * transfer profit buys a world class card. Gems only come in through:
 *   - a small grant when the career starts
 *   - watching an ad, capped per season so the reward stays scarce
 *   - promotion, a milestone bonus
 *
 * The hard rule that protects the difficulty ramp: no pack may ever produce a
 * player better than the BASE of the division one tier above yours. A card two
 * tiers up would break both the calibrated match engine and the whole climb.
 *
 * The three packs are separated by UPSIDE as much as by rating, because
 * leagueCeiling only grows 5.5 per division and rating alone leaves no room:
 *   boost, a young player who will grow into the side
 *   star,  young and already good
 *   pro,   good right now, at the level of the division above
