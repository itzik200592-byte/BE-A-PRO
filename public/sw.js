/**
 * The smallest service worker that makes the game installable.
 *
 * Chrome will not offer "add to home screen" at all without one, which is why
 * the install prompt never appeared. It deliberately does NOT cache: this game
 * ships several times a day, and a caching worker is the classic way to leave
 * players staring at last week's build with no idea why. Every request goes
 * straight to the network exactly as it would without a worker.
 *
 * If offline play is ever wanted, that is a deliberate feature with a version
 * stamp and a cache bust, not something to smuggle in here.
