/**
 * Does the division stay the division?
 *
 * It used to be rebuilt from scratch every summer, so a manager who stayed up
 * came back to seven clubs he had never seen, and in ליגה ג׳ the real towns he
 * picked at the start were replaced by a pool of invented names. Nothing about
 * a career felt continuous because nothing was.
 *
 * Staying up, the rule is: the two who went up leave, the one at the bottom
 * leaves, everybody else is exactly who they were. Changing division really is
 * a new set of people, and they come from the same region.
