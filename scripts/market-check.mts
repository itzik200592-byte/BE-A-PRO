/**
 * The summer market moves, and it ends on a name worth saving for.

 * What it holds to:
 *   1. the three summer rounds are never the same twelve players
 *   2. nobody vanishes without a round's warning
 *   3. the last round carries exactly one marquee, clear of the rest and priced
 *      like a real decision rather than pocket change
 *   4. the squad always still has a keeper and every line to buy from
