 *
 * A new shirt every summer is only worth having if four things hold, and every
 * one of them is easy to break without noticing:
 *
 *   the colour is the identity and NEVER moves, so the crest still matches;
 *   the shirt he was given actually reaches the pitch, not just the reveal;
 *   the first shirt is the one HE chose, not one generated over the top of it;
 *   every shirt is readable, against its own trim and against everyone else's.
 *
 * So this walks whole careers, one per palette colour, through wins, promotions
 * and relegations, and measures the wardrobe that comes out.
