/**
 * The phone's back button.
 *   node --experimental-strip-types scripts/back-check.mts
 *
 * On Android, back is how people navigate everything, and in here it threw them
 * straight out of the game. Every tester read it as a crash.
 *
 * The failure mode this guards against is not the wiring breaking — it is the
 * wiring going stale. Somebody adds a screen with a back arrow next month, the
 * arrow works, and the phone's own button silently does something else on that
 * screen and nobody notices for a season. So this reads the App and insists the
 * two ways out agree with each other, screen by screen.
