/**
 * Cards, and whether a sending off is real.
 *   node --experimental-strip-types scripts/discipline-check.mts
 *
 * A tester reported a red card in every match of his first season. The rate was
 * high — three or four times real football — but the thing that made it feel
 * constant was worse than the rate: four out of five red cards in the game were
 * a caption over nothing. The ticker said "אדום! X מורחק" and X carried on
 * playing the other fifty minutes, because the only path that actually took a
 * man off the pitch was the sliding tackle. The side never went down to ten.
 *
 * So this measures both halves of it: how often it happens, and whether it
 * happened at all.
