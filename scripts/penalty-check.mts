 *
 * Itzik asked for a penalty roughly every three matches, split between winning
 * one and giving one away. A rate is the kind of thing that is very easy to
 * believe you have set and very easy to have not: the two rolls sit inside
 * functions that return early for other reasons, so the number that matters is
 * the one that comes out of playing thousands of matches, not the constant.
 *
 * It also holds the things that make a penalty a moment rather than a dice
 * roll: it is always the manager's call, guessing right actually matters, a
 * better keeper saves more, and the whistle does not care how good the
 * opponent is.
