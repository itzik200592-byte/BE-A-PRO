 * These are the rules that keep that honest:
 *   1. facts are read out of the events truthfully, never invented
 *   2. a press conference is two questions whenever the match gave him one
 *   3. answering the first leads to the second, not out of the room
 *   4. across a whole season he is not asking the same thing every week
