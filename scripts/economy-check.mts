/**
 * Can the club actually pay its bills?
 *
 * Money used to be floored at zero, so a structurally bankrupt economy was
 * invisible: the debt simply evaporated every round. The moment debt became
 * real, eleven of twelve brand new careers were sacked inside their first
 * season. This is the guard against that ever being true again.
 *
 * Two questions, both of them about the path a real player takes:
 *   a brand new career, untouched, must survive season one
 *   a mid table club in any division must not be bankrupted by simply existing
 *
 * The scripted crisis in ליגה א׳ and the לאומית is switched off here on purpose.
 * It is a story beat that bankrupts every club by design, and leaving it on
 * would drown out the thing this file exists to measure: whether the wages,
 * prizes, gate and sponsor add up on their own.
